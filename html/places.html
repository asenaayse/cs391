<p class="ftitle">PLACES YOU SHOULD VISIT IN İSTANBUL</p>

<img id="img" src="../images/dolmabahce.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Dolmabahce Palace</p>
<p > This palace was built in the mid 1800s to replace an earlier structure that was made of wood. The new palace incorporated sixteen separate buildings with stables, a flour mill and a clock tower among them. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/hagia.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Hagia Sophia</p>
<p > This architectural marvel displays 30 million gold tiles throughout its interior, and a wide, flat dome which was a bold engineering feat at the time it was constructed in the 6th century. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/suleymaniye.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Suleymaniye Mosque</p>
<p > Famed architect Sinan built this majestic structure for one of the greatest rulers of the Ottoman Empire. Although this mosque is less ornate, there are many similarities between it and the Hagia Sophia since the same architect was responsible for both. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/topkapi.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Topkapi Palace</p>
<p > This enormous palace was the Imperial residence of Ottoman sultans for almost 400 years. Although much of the palace is not accessible, the daily tours of the Harem are of great interest to tourists. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/galata.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Galata Tower</p>
<p > Built in 500 A.D., Galata Tower is one of the dominating landmarks of Istanbul. It was used as a watchtower to help defend the city. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/rahmikoc.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Rahmi M. Koc Museum</p>
<p > The Rahmi M Koç Museum is the first major museum in Turkey dedicated to the history of Transport, Industry and Communications. Housed in magnificent buildings - themselves prime examples of industrial archaeology - on the shore of the historic Golden Horn, the collection contains thousands of items from gramophone needles to full size ships and aircraft. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/miniaturk.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Miniaturk </p>
<p > Minaturk is just what it sounds like: a mini version of treasures found in Turkey. The park contains 105 models done in 1/25th scale, about half of them from Istanbul and the rest from Anatolia and the Ottoman territories outside of Turkey. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/ortakoy.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Ortakoy</p>
<p > This charming neighborhood of renovated old buildings is home to many restaurants, shops and artist galleries. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/balat.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Balat</p>
<p > This neighborhood of Istanbul was once known as the Jewish quarter of the city. Today you can still find many synagogues here, as well as a more diverse group of residents. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/eyupsultan.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Eyup Sultan Mosque</p>
<p > This mosque stands outside the city walls at the location where Hz Eyyubu El-Ensari, a noted Islamic individual, died in the assault on Constantinople in 670 AD. </p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/kizkulesi.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Kız Kulesi</p>
<p > According to Turkish legend, a princess was locked in this tower to protect her from being bitten by a snake. Over the years the tower has been used as a customs station, lighthouse and a residence for retired naval officers.</p>
<br><br>
<img id="img" src="../images/bosphorus.png">
<p style="font-size:25px ;color:red;">Bosphorus Bridge</p>
<p > The Bosporus or Bosphorus, also known as the Strait of Istanbul, is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey. It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and divides Turkey by separating Anatolia from Thrace </p>
