## HOW TO RUN PROJECT 
First, install json server and axios by running the following commands on cmd:
npm install -g json-server
npm install axios
On terminal, go to fake-server folder and run "json-server --watch db.json" command
"local.host3000" address must appear, copy and paste it  to your browser. Now you are connected to the fake server.
Then, go to VsCode, right click on App.js, select "open with integrated terminal" and run the following commands:
npm install
npm install react-icons --save
npm install --save react-toastify

## USING ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES
As a team, we did use additional library to beautify visually. We use react-icons and toastify libraries for tic-tac-toe game. Also, we use reactstrap library for designing pages.
